      <ul class="space-y-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground/80">
        <li>
          <strong>Async Architectural PR Reviews:</strong> I join your GitHub repo and review the pull requests that matter most so your architecture stays sharp.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Embedded Mentorship for Leads and Senior ICs:</strong> We keep a standing thread to level up decision-makers, pair through tricky refactors, and grow internal ownership.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Two 90-minute Team Solver Sessions per Month:</strong> Use these to unblock projects, architect new features, or pressure-test plans together.

          <strong>Priority Slack Channel:</strong> Your team has a direct line for questions, clarifications, and quick feedback without waiting for the next meeting.

      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground/80">
        This is my "easy decision" guarantee. Try the retainer for 30 days. Let me join your Slack, review your PRs, and run our first Solver Session.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground/80">
        If at the end of those 30 days you don't feel you've already received more value than you paid for, just tell me. I will refund 100% of your first month's fee—no questions asked.

      <ul class="space-y-2 text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground/80">
        <li>✅ Teams that need a senior "Solver" without hiring a €200k/year Principal Engineer.</li>
        <li>✅ Tech leads who are stretched thin and want a trusted partner to review code and brainstorm with.</li>
        <li>✅ Teams adopting new tech (like TCA or GenAI) who want to avoid the common pitfalls.</li>
        <li>✅ Teams that prefer async-first collaboration and dislike unnecessary meetings.</li>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Not Ideal For</h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground/80">
        <li>❌ Teams that need a full-time (40h/w) hands-on developer.</li>
