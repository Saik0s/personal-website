const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Why does this take six weeks if you only work 10 hours per week?",
    answer:
      "Your team needs time between touchpoints to ship code while the context is fresh. Six weeks gives us room to design, implement, validate, and document without burning out your engineers. If I joined full-time for two weeks, you'd get code you didn't help build. This model ensures your team owns the solution and keeps momentum after I'm gone.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can't you just work full-time for a shorter period?",
    answer:
      "I intentionally keep a full-time role so my advice is grounded in current production realities. My consulting capacity is capped at 10 hours per week, which I reserve for design authority work. If you need full-time implementation, I can introduce trusted contractors while I stay involved for architecture oversight.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much time does this require from my team?",
    answer:
      "Plan on one to two engineers dedicating meaningful time each week. They will implement the architecture, attend the 90-minute session, and act on daily review feedback. If your team cannot commit this time, the sprint will stall—consider booking targeted Sessions instead until you free capacity.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if the problem turns out to be bigger than six weeks?",
    answer:
      "We focus on the highest-leverage slice. If we uncover more work, we can scope a follow-up sprint, transition to the monthly Retainer, or hand off a roadmap your team executes. Most teams ship the critical fix inside the initial six-week window and continue independently.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you write code or only review?",
    answer:
      "Both. Expect me to draft architecture spikes, example implementations, and pair on tricky parts. Your team still writes most of the production code so they fully understand it. Think 80% design and review, 20% hands-on pairing where it matters most.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if we already ran an audit?",
    answer:
      "Great—bring the findings. We'll choose the highest-impact recommendation and execute it together so the audit stops collecting dust. Many teams have outstanding reports with no plan to implement; this sprint converts the plan into shipped improvements.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we extend beyond six weeks?",
    answer:
      "Yes. If you want continued oversight, we can scope another sprint or move into the €1,600/month Retainer. Some teams alternate: sprint to tackle a major blocker, retainer to maintain momentum.",
