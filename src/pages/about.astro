  <p>
    I'm Igor Tarasenko, a product-minded engineer based in Amsterdam. I help teams ship fast iOS experiences, production-ready agent workflows, and developer tooling that sticks.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Work On</h2>
  <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground/80">
    <strong>Complete Solutions</strong> — I build end-to-end. iOS apps (WhisperBoard: 50k+ downloads, 4.8★), backends (FastAPI, Node, Rails), ML model deployment (CoreML, ONNX, cloud inference), web apps (React, Astro). Whatever the solution needs.
  </p>
  <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground/80">
    <strong>Finding Real Leverage</strong> — I help teams identify where technology creates actual advantage vs where it's hype. Recent work: reduced a team's LLM costs from €2k/month to €40/month while improving quality. Cut another team's iOS build times by 35% through architecture changes.
  </p>
  <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground/80">
    <strong>AI Integration &amp; Deployment</strong> — Pragmatic AI that works in production. On-device ML (CoreML, Whisper), LLM orchestration, and agentic workflows. I've been hands-on since SD 1.5, preferring direct, robust solutions over bloated frameworks.
  </p>
  <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground/80">
    <strong>Complex Architectures</strong> — 16 years dealing with messy systems. iOS (TCA, SwiftUI, modularization), backends (API design, data models, scaling), infrastructure (deployments, monitoring, CI/CD). Making large systems maintainable and teams productive.
  </p>
  <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground/80">
    <strong>Refactoring &amp; Modernization</strong> — Incremental rewrites without breaking production. Mobile (UIKit → SwiftUI, MVVM → TCA), backend (monolith → services), infrastructure (local → cloud). Strangler-fig patterns, dependency injection, metrics-driven migration.
  </p>
  <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground/80">
    <strong>Developer Experience</strong> — Build tooling (Tuist, Gradle, Webpack), CI/CD pipelines, local development speed, onboarding documentation, debugging workflows. The stuff that makes teams ship faster or grind to a halt.
  </p>

  <h3>Hands-on GenAI Expertise</h3>
  <p>
    I've been deep in Generative AI since early 2023. I went to the first AI hackathon in Amsterdam and built an iOS app that changed room interiors using Stable Diffusion 1.5 hosted on my own Macbook.
  </p>
  <p>Since then, I've been hands-on in the space:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Early Adopter:</strong> I started using ComfyUI when it had less than 1,000 GitHub stars and have deployed SD and Flux models on platforms like Modal.com.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Agentic Engineering:</strong> I've been automating my own software engineering work since GPT-4's release, using Python libraries for vector stores, structured output, and agents.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Pragmatic Tooling:</strong> I was an early user of LangChain, but I've since moved away from it, as I find it's often overkill and promotes bad code. I prefer a direct, pragmatic approach to building.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Proof</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Shipped <strong>WhisperBoard</strong> &mdash; on-device transcription (50k+ downloads, 4.8★ App Store, 888★ GitHub).</li>
    <li><strong>35% build time reduction</strong> for large SwiftUI codebase via modularization and Tuist.</li>
    <li><strong>95% LLM cost savings</strong> (€2k → €40/month) through caching, routing, and prompt optimization.</li>
    <li><strong>Team enablement</strong>: mentored engineering leads rolling out AI-powered workflows across mobile + backend squads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Values</h2>
  <p>
    Ukrainian roots, Amsterdam base. I bias toward clarity, tight feedback loops, and making sure teams can operate without me after each engagement.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hands-on:</strong> I deliver diffs, docs, and recorded walkthroughs&mdash;not just slide decks.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> Sessions are €200/hr in 1&ndash;10 hour blocks; workshops are scoped with clear deliverables.</li>
    <li><strong>Pragmatic:</strong> Every recommendation is grounded in production constraints.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Work Together</h2>
  <p>I have <strong>limited availability</strong> and typically work with 1&ndash;2 clients at a time.</p>
  <p>My focus is on long-term partnerships, not one-off projects. I offer a small, focused set of services to help teams solve their hardest problems.</p>
