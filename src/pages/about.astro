      "Igor Tarasenko — senior iOS engineer and agentic automation specialist based in Amsterdam.",
  }}
>
  <p>
    I'm Igor Tarasenko, a product-minded engineer based in Amsterdam. I help teams ship fast iOS experiences, production-ready agent workflows, and developer tooling that actually gets adopted.
  </p>

  <h2>Where I Add Leverage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>iOS Engineering:</strong> architecture reviews, SwiftUI migrations, performance triage, and App Store delivery.</li>
    <li><strong>Agentic Automation:</strong> design, prototype, and harden agent-driven workflows with real guardrails.</li>
    <li><strong>Developer Enablement:</strong> custom tooling, build observability, and enablement playbooks for engineering leads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Proof</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Shipped on-device transcription app <strong>WhisperBoard</strong> — 50k+ downloads, 4.8★ App Store, 888★ on GitHub.</li>
    <li>Built automation agents trusted by enterprise support teams to triage and resolve tickets.</li>
    <li>Led modularization and CI improvements for large SwiftUI codebases, cutting build times by 35%.</li>
    <li>Mentored senior engineers rolling out LLM-powered developer workflows across mobile and backend stacks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Values</h2>
  <p>
    Ukrainian roots, Amsterdam base. I bias toward clarity, tight feedback loops, and making sure teams can operate without me after each engagement.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hands-on:</strong> I deliver diffs, docs, and recorded walkthroughs—not just slide decks.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparent:</strong> Sessions are booked at €200/hr in 1–10 hour blocks.</li>
    <li><strong>Pragmatic:</strong> Every recommendation is grounded in production constraints.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Work Together</h2>
  <p>
    Sessions happen remotely, scoped in advance, and wrap with documented outcomes. Book a block and include code access or context so we can start fast.
