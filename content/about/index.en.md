I'm **Igor**. I make iOS apps that kick ass and make bank.

- **13+ years** building slick, user-friendly stuff
- **Millions of downloads** at Uber
- Helped tons of devs level up

I turn messy ideas into smooth, satisfying apps that deliver. My story?

Ukrainian kid. Rough start. Found freedom in code. Moved to Amsterdam. Now I'm all about:

- Crafting iOS apps that solve real problems
- Using AI to make apps smarter
- Dropping knowledge bombs for fellow devs

Off the clock? **Dad. Husband. Learning junkie.** I eat challenges for breakfast and always push to get better.
